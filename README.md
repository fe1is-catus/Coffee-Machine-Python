# Coffee-Machine-Python
Project: Coffee Machine, JetBrains / Python

What I do and what I learn:

1/6 Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

2/6 Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

3/6 Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

4/6 Upgrade your knowledge of functions – set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

5/6 Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

6/6 Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly. Classes
