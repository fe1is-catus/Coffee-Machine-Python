# Coffee-Machine-Python
Project: Coffee Machine, JetBrains / Python

What I do and what I learn:

Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

Upgrade your knowledge of functions – set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly. Classes
